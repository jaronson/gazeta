      %p There's a picture I cannot find of Mississippi Fred Mcdowell in an old garage somewhere. In the picture he's sitting on a bentwood chair, smallbody guitar on his lap, surrounded by stuff piled on every surface. He's playing slide with a pocket knife the whole time never looking up from the neck of that guitar.

      %p There are performers, men and women who give each show their blood, sweat and tears. Mississippi Fred Mcdowell is no performer. To sing while playing and while meeting your audience's eye takes a practiced gaze. Miss. Fred says forget all that. And he doesn't come begrudgingly, but with the understanding that the reason for his being there is known to both he and you and why make a fuss about it? There's a definite sport of showmanship in showmanship's absence, just ask Bob Dylan circa 1966 &mdash; but even this is a poor analogy. Miss. Fred's not outwardly hostile to his audience.

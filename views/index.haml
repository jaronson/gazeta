        %p
          be kind, be gentle, be meek<br/>
          know that all living seek<br/>
          a roof of banana leaves<br/>
          the thought some familiar life breathes<br/>
          so be kind, be gentle, be meek
        %p
          be kind, be gentle, be meek<br/>
          know that all living seek<br/>
          to drink, to break bread<br/>
          to be comforted, to be fed<br/>
          so be kind, be gentle, be meek
        %p
          there will forever be power in pain<br/>
          your walk one of silence and dread<br/>
          when you feel too much wrought<br/>
          be calmed by the thought<br/>
          we all grasp a common thread<br/>
        %p
          be kind, be gentle, be meek<br/>
          know that all living seek<br/>
          to have and to hold<br/>
          young, old<br/>
          be kind, be gentle, be meek

      %h2 Highway 169 runs nearly true west.
      %p It runs west through country writ large, across an antediluvian plain, corn and soybean fields either side, new shooted stalks bent groundwards in the wind made in passing and in passing only. Past tarpaper sided houses white and baking in the noonday sun, vinyl sided dreams and crumbling ruins, wavy through the heat lines, glimpses of a past remote, wasted and ruined.
      %p Through Karnak Illinois, grave of the gods, aptly named were it any gods deigned to die and be buried in this place. This place if ever known now forgivingly forgotten. Here death is no purview reserved for gods alone. Here death is democratic, the townfolk, businesses, livestock, economies of scale, the land itself. Travel down through other towns, Thebes, Dongola, Palestine, Lebanon, after ancient eastern cities so named. Read their epitaphs painted on the river walls.
